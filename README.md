# StringAlgebra

Rigorous formalization of algebraic structures in string theory in Lean 4 with Mathlib. All definitions and proofs build purely on Mathlib's foundations. `axiom` is strictly forbidden.

### L-infinity Algebras

Core infrastructure for L-infinity (strong homotopy Lie) algebras, including the symmetric coalgebra/coderivation approach, morphisms, homotopy transfer, Maurer-Cartan theory, DGLAs, BV structures, and the formality/quantization pipeline.

Current audited status (2026-02-26):

1. `lake build StringAlgebra.Linfinity` passes.
2. `StringAlgebra/Linfinity` is currently `sorry`-free.
3. No `axiom`/`admit`/`Classical.choose`/`Classical.epsilon` usage in Linfinity Lean files.
4. Recent hardening removed fabricated transfer/formality/BV outputs and tautological bridge shells; nontrivial constructions now require explicit witness data rather than hidden defaults, both `LInftyHom` and core `LInftyMorphism` composition have explicit identity/derived composition data and core morphisms now enforce arity-0 normalization (`higher_zero`), DGLA-to-L∞ transport plus `LInftyHom`/core-morphism conversion now have explicit bridge infrastructure with bidirectional quasi-isomorphism criterion equivalence for canonical lifts, explicit higher-shape constraints on canonical lift witnesses, and higher-component round-trip preservation, homotopy-transfer in the core `LInfinityAlgebra` interface now carries explicit linear and quasi-isomorphism certification for the lifted inclusion, coderivation/L∞ extraction interfaces now enforce unary consistency between multilinear and linear witness layers, map/component agreement on matching word lengths, explicit unary-output shape constraints for extracted components, and explicit equivalence between map-level/component-level vanishing formulations, Maurer-Cartan Kuranishi local models now require explicit `KuranishiTheory` data (no hardcoded zero map), Maurer-Cartan gauge equivalence now has explicit relation lemmas plus a canonical `Setoid`, smoothness now exposes an explicit moduli-point constructor, MC twisting/tangent-obstruction interfaces now use witness-aligned naming/documentation, and MC moduli classes now have an explicit projection/characterization (`a.toModuli = b.toModuli ↔ GaugeEquivalent T a b`), `LInftyHomotopy` now carries an explicit first-order linear homotopy equation with canonical data-level `refl/symm/trans` constructors plus induced `Setoid` and homotopy-class quotient interfaces, transfer-level minimal-model uniqueness now returns explicit quasi-isomorphic comparison data rather than bare existence, transfer-level formality now has an explicit unpacked interface equivalent to `isFormal` plus canonical accessor morphisms, BV now records its current `Δ`-closure assumption explicitly as `triple_delta_zero` rather than claiming the full seven-term identity, and formality-level MC transport plus star-product gauge equivalence/gauge-class interfaces now include a direct classification bridge at quotient-class level with normalized, data-preserving gauge transformations and witness-aligned theorem naming.
5. Remaining semantic debt is tracked explicitly in `StringAlgebra/Linfinity/TODO.md`.

Current dependency flow toward `Formality.lean`:

  └─> SymmetricCoalgebra

SymmetricCoalgebra -> Coderivations -> LInfinityAlgebra -> Morphisms
ChainComplex -> DGLA
LInfinityAlgebra + DGLA + Morphisms -> MaurerCartan
MaurerCartan -> Transfer
DGLA + Morphisms -> Formality
Transfer + SymmetricAlgebra -> BVAlgebra
```

Theorem-critical flow toward deformation quantization:

```text

```

Detailed dependency debt tracking, anti-smuggling gates, and closure order are maintained in `StringAlgebra/Linfinity/TODO.md`.

### Multiple Zeta Values

Shuffle and stuffle algebras, double shuffle relations, iterated integrals, polylogarithms, Drinfeld associators, and motivic MZVs.

Current audited status (2026-02-26):

1. `lake build StringAlgebra.MZV` passes.
2. `StringAlgebra/MZV` is `sorry`-free.
3. No `axiom`/`admit`/`Classical.choose`/`Classical.epsilon` usage in MZV Lean files.
4. Remaining semantic/proof debt is tracked in `StringAlgebra/MZV/TODO.md` (including finite-basis double-shuffle interfaces and explicit Ihara-derivation structural lemmas).

Current dependency flow:

```text
Basic -> ShuffleAlgebra -> DoubleShuffle -> Motivic -> Associator
Basic -> StuffleAlgebra -> DoubleShuffle -> Relations
Basic -> Polylogarithm
ShuffleAlgebra -> IteratedIntegral
```

### Vertex Operator Algebras

Vertex algebras, formal distributions, modules, the Virasoro algebra, and examples.

Current audited status (2026-02-26):

1. `lake build StringAlgebra.VOA` passes.
2. `StringAlgebra/VOA` is `sorry`-free.
3. No `axiom`/`admit`/`Classical.choose`/`Classical.epsilon` usage in VOA Lean files.
4. Recent hardening removed `Classical.choose`-based conformal-weight extraction and replaced fabricated Dong/antibracket-style outputs with explicit witness-driven contracts, including explicit lattice rationality criterion packages, positive fusion-rule bound theorems under rationality assumptions, and derived locality symmetry constructors.
5. Remaining semantic/proof debt is tracked in `StringAlgebra/VOA/TODO.md`.

Current dependency flow:

```text
Basic -> FormalDistributions -> VertexAlgebra -> Virasoro -> Modules -> Examples
```

### Modular Tensor Categories

Full hierarchy from pivotal categories to the Verlinde formula:

**Pivotal** → **Trace** → **Spherical** → **Ribbon** → **Semisimple** → **Fusion** → **Endomorphism** → **Braided Fusion** → **Ribbon Fusion** → **S-Matrix** → **Modular Tensor Category** → **Verlinde**

Definitions include fusion coefficients N^m\_{ij}, the S-matrix, T-matrix, quantum dimensions, the Mueger center, and TQFT dimensions. All definitions are proper (no axiom smuggling, no placeholders). Key proofs completed include the twist on the unit, braiding symmetry of fusion coefficients, closure of transparent objects under tensor products, Schur's lemma applications, and the Verlinde genus-1 dimension formula. A bridge module connects VOA representation categories to MTCs via Huang's theorem.
