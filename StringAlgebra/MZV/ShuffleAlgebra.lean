# Shuffle Algebra

This file defines the shuffle product on words, which is fundamental to the
algebraic structure of multiple zeta values.

## Main definitions

* `shuffle` - The shuffle product of two words

## Mathematical Background

### The Shuffle Product

For words w = a₁...aₘ and v = b₁...bₙ, their shuffle product is:

  w ш v = Σ_{σ ∈ Sh(m,n)} σ(a₁...aₘb₁...bₙ)

where Sh(m,n) is the set of (m,n)-shuffles: permutations σ of {1,...,m+n}
such that σ(1) < ... < σ(m) and σ(m+1) < ... < σ(m+n).

Equivalently, by the recursive formula:
  ε ш w = w ш ε = w
  (a·u) ш (b·v) = a·(u ш (b·v)) + b·((a·u) ш v)

### Properties

The shuffle product is:
1. **Commutative**: w ш v = v ш w (as multisets)
2. **Associative**: (u ш v) ш w = u ш (v ш w)
3. **Unital**: ε ш w = w ш ε = w (ε = empty word)

### Connection to MZVs

The shuffle product encodes the product of iterated integrals:
  (∫ω_{w}) · (∫ω_{v}) = ∫ω_{w ш v}

This gives one of the two product structures on MZVs.

/-- The shuffle product of two words.

    - ε ш w = [w]
    - w ш ε = [w]
    - (a::u) ш (b::v) = a::(u ш (b::v)) + b::((a::u) ш v)

    Returns a list of words (the multiset of shuffled words). -/
