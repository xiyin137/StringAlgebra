# Explicit MZV Relations

This file collects explicit relations among multiple zeta values,
providing concrete instances of the general double shuffle framework.

## Main definitions

* `SumFormula` - The sum formula Σ ζ(a,{1}ᵇ) = ζ(a+b)
* `DualityRelation` - Duality relating ζ(s) and ζ(s†)
* `DerivationRelation` - Ihara's derivation relations
* `Ohno` - Ohno's relations generalizing sum and duality

## Mathematical Background

### The Sum Formula

For integers a ≥ 2 and b ≥ 0:
  Σ_{i=0}^{b} ζ(a+i, {1}^{b-i}) = ζ(a+b)

where {1}^k means k copies of 1.

### Duality

The duality involution on compositions:
  (s₁, ..., sₖ)† = (tₖ, ..., t₁)

where t is obtained by reading s in "01-notation" backwards and swapping 0↔1.

Theorem: ζ(s) = ζ(s†) for admissible s.

### Ohno's Relations

Generalize both sum formula and duality. For a composition s and
non-negative integers eᵢ:
  Σ ζ(s₁+e₁, ..., sₖ+eₖ) = Σ ζ(t₁+f₁, ..., tₘ+fₘ)

where the sums run over partitions of a fixed total.

### Derivation Relations

Ihara's derivations D_n satisfy Lie algebra relations and
act on MZVs giving linear relations.
