# Motivic Multiple Zeta Values

This file develops the theory of motivic multiple zeta values following
Francis Brown's foundational work.

## Main definitions

* `MotivicMZV` - The algebra of motivic MZVs
* `Coaction` - The motivic coaction Δ
* `DeRhamProjection` - The de Rham period map

## Mathematical Background

### Motivic MZVs

The key insight of Brown and others is that MZVs are periods of mixed Tate
motives over ℤ. The motivic framework provides:

1. A natural "lift" of numerical MZVs to motivic objects
2. A coaction that captures "hidden structure"
3. Clean separation of algebraic and transcendental aspects

### The Algebra H = H^MT

The Hopf algebra of motivic MZVs is:
  H = ⊕_n H_n

with:
- Multiplication from shuffle/stuffle
- Coproduct Δ : H → H ⊗ H (the motivic coaction)
- Antipode S (from Hopf algebra structure)

### The Coaction

For a motivic MZV ζ^m(s), the coaction is:
  Δ(ζ^m(s)) = ζ^m(s) ⊗ 1 + 1 ⊗ ζ^m(s) + (lower terms)

The "lower terms" involve products of MZVs of lower depth/weight.

### Brown's Theorem

Brown proved that:
1. Motivic MZVs form a graded Hopf algebra
2. The coaction is coassociative
3. There is a faithful period map to ℂ

### The f-alphabet and Derivations

Brown introduces letters f₃, f₅, f₇, ... (one for each odd weight ≥ 3)
and shows that motivic MZVs can be written as:
  ζ^m(s) = polynomial in f's with rational coefficients

    Mathematically, these are framed mixed Tate motives.
    The key property is that they satisfy the same shuffle/stuffle
    relations as numerical MZVs, but with additional structure. -/

    MZVs generate a ℚ-subalgebra of ℂ. Understanding its structure
    is a major open problem. -/

    mixed Tate motives arising from P¹ \ {0, 1, ∞}. -/
