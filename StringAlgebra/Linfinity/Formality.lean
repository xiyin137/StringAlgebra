# Kontsevich's Formality Theorem

This file states Kontsevich's formality theorem and derives deformation quantization.

## Main Results

* `FormalityMorphism` - The L∞ quasi-isomorphism U : T_poly → D_poly
* `formalityTheorem` - Existence of the formality morphism
* `deformationQuantization` - Every Poisson manifold admits a star product

## Mathematical Background

### The Formality Theorem

Let M be a smooth manifold. The formality theorem states there exists an
L∞ quasi-isomorphism U : T_poly(M) → D_poly(M) where:

- T_poly(M) = polyvector fields with Schouten bracket (DGLA with d = 0)
- D_poly(M) = Hochschild cochains with Gerstenhaber bracket and differential b

### The Kontsevich Formula

The L∞ morphism U has components:
  U_n : Sym^n(T_poly) → D_poly  of degree 1-n

given by summing over admissible graphs:
  U_n(γ₁,...,γₙ) = ∑_{Γ} w_Γ · B_Γ(γ₁,...,γₙ; -)

where w_Γ is the weight (configuration space integral) and B_Γ is the
bidifferential operator associated to graph Γ.

### Deformation Quantization

A Poisson structure π is a Maurer-Cartan element in T_poly (since d = 0,
the MC equation is just [π,π]_S = 0, which is the Jacobi identity).

L∞ morphisms preserve MC elements: U maps π to an MC element μ in D_poly[[ℏ]].
This MC element encodes a star product:
  f ⋆ g = fg + ∑_{n≥1} ℏⁿ μₙ(f,g)

For a DGLA (V, d, [-,-]), the Maurer-Cartan equation is:
  d(a) + (1/2)[a,a] = 0

When d = 0 (as for polyvector fields), this reduces to [a,a] = 0.

/-! ## Formal Power Series and Formal MC Elements

For deformation quantization, we work over R[[ℏ]] - formal power series in ℏ.
A "formal Poisson structure" is ∑_{n≥0} ℏⁿ πₙ satisfying [π,π] = 0 mod ℏ.

    The associativity of the star product follows from this equation.

    Expanding in powers of ℏ, the MC equation gives:

/-! ## The Formality Theorem

Kontsevich's formality theorem is an **explicit construction**: it provides a
concrete formula for an L∞ quasi-isomorphism U : T_poly → D_poly.

The construction has three parts:
1. **Definition**: U_n is defined as a sum over admissible graphs
2. **L∞ property**: The L∞ equations follow from Stokes' theorem
3. **Quasi-iso property**: U₁ = HKR induces iso on cohomology
-/

/-- **The Kontsevich Formality Morphism** (explicit construction)

    For each n ≥ 1, define U_n : Sym^n(T_poly) → D_poly by the graph formula:

    U_n(γ₁,...,γₙ) = ∑_{Γ admissible} w_Γ · B_Γ(γ₁,...,γₙ; -)

    where:
    - Γ ranges over admissible Kontsevich graphs with n aerial vertices
    - w_Γ = ∫_{Conf_n(H⁺)} ∧_e dφ_e is the configuration space integral
    - B_Γ is the bidifferential operator contracting γᵢ along edges of Γ

    Special case n=1: U₁ is the HKR (Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg) map
    U₁(X₁∧...∧Xₖ)(f₁,...,fₖ) = (1/k!) ∑_σ sgn(σ) X_{σ(1)}(f₁)···X_{σ(k)}(fₖ) -/

      (data.dPoly.toDGLAData.toLInftyAlgebra) :=
  sorry  -- Construction via graph formula

/-- **Kontsevich's Formality Theorem, Part 1**: The graph formula defines an L∞ morphism.

    The maps U_n satisfy the L∞ morphism compatibility equations:

    For all n ≥ 1 and homogeneous γᵢ ∈ T_poly:
    d(Uₙ(γ₁ ∧ ... ∧ γₙ)) - ∑ᵢ ± Uₙ(γ₁ ∧ ... ∧ dγᵢ ∧ ... ∧ γₙ)
      = (1/2) ∑_{k+l=n} (1/k!l!) ∑_σ ± [U_k(γ_{σ(1)},...), U_l(γ_{σ(k+1)},...)]
        + ∑_{i<j} ± U_{n-1}([γᵢ,γⱼ] ∧ γ₁ ∧ ... ∧ γₙ)

    The first two equations are:
    - n=1: d(U₁(γ)) = U₁(dγ)  [U₁ is a chain map]
    - n=2: d(U₂(γ₁∧γ₂)) - U₂(dγ₁∧γ₂) ± U₂(γ₁∧dγ₂) = U₁([γ₁,γ₂]) - [U₁(γ₁),U₁(γ₂)]

    **Proof**: Apply Stokes' theorem to the compactified configuration space.
    The boundary ∂C̄_{n,m} decomposes into strata:
    - S1: Points cluster in H (gives bracket terms)
    - S2: Points approach R (gives Hochschild differential terms)
    The integral over ∂ vanishes by Stokes, giving the L∞ relations. -/

    The linear part U₁ : T_poly → D_poly induces an isomorphism on cohomology:
    H*(T_poly, d=0) ≅ H*(D_poly, b)

    Since d = 0 on T_poly, we have H*(T_poly) = T_poly.
    By the HKR theorem, H*(D_poly, b) ≅ T_poly.
    And U₁ = HKR realizes this isomorphism.

    Therefore U is a quasi-isomorphism. -/

/-! ## Transfer of Maurer-Cartan Elements

L∞ morphisms preserve Maurer-Cartan elements. This is the key to
deriving deformation quantization from the formality theorem.
-/

/-- L∞ morphisms map Maurer-Cartan elements to Maurer-Cartan elements.

    If F : L → L' is an L∞ morphism and a ∈ L¹ is MC in L, then
    F̃(a) := ∑_{n≥1} (1/n!) Fₙ(a,...,a) ∈ L'¹
    is MC in L'.

    **Proof** (Kontsevich, Section 4.3):
    The MC equation d(a) + (1/2)[a,a] = 0 in L implies
    d(F̃(a)) + (1/2)[F̃(a),F̃(a)] = 0 in L'

    This follows because the L∞ morphism equations encode exactly the
    compatibility needed: F intertwines the coderivations D and D'
    on the symmetric coalgebras, so zeros of D map to zeros of D'.

    For formality: a Poisson structure π (MC in T_poly with d=0)
    maps to an MC element U(ℏπ) in D_poly[[ℏ]], encoding a star product. -/

    **Proof using formality**:
    1. π is a Poisson structure ⟹ [π,π]_S = 0, so π is MC in T_poly (since d=0)
    2. U : T_poly → D_poly[[ℏ]] is an L∞ quasi-isomorphism (formality theorem)

    More precisely, by Theorem 1.3 of Kontsevich's paper:
    The set of gauge equivalence classes of star products on M is in
    natural bijection with the set of equivalence classes of formal
    Poisson structures α(ℏ) = α₁ℏ + α₂ℏ² + ... with [α,α] = 0,

/-! ## Physical Interpretation -/

/-- In quantum mechanics, the commutator of observables gives:
    [f, g] := f ⋆ g - g ⋆ f = iℏ{f,g} + O(ℏ²)

    For canonical coordinates (xⁱ, pⱼ) on T*ℝⁿ with the standard
    symplectic Poisson structure {xⁱ, pⱼ} = δⁱⱼ, the star product gives:

    xⁱ ⋆ pⱼ - pⱼ ⋆ xⁱ = iℏ δⁱⱼ + O(ℏ²)

    This recovers the canonical commutation relations of quantum mechanics.

    **Proof**: From the star product formula f ⋆ g = fg + ℏB₁(f,g) + O(ℏ²),
    where B₁⁻(f,g) = {f,g}/2 is the antisymmetric part.
    So f ⋆ g - g ⋆ f = 2ℏB₁⁻(f,g) + O(ℏ²) = ℏ{f,g} + O(ℏ²). -/

/-- The Cattaneo-Felder interpretation (1999):

    Kontsevich's formula arises from the perturbative expansion of
    the Poisson sigma model path integral on the disk.

    The Poisson sigma model is a 2D topological field theory with:
    - Fields: X : Σ → M (maps from worldsheet to target Poisson manifold)
              η ∈ Ω¹(Σ, X*T*M) (auxiliary 1-form)
    - Action: S = ∫_Σ ηᵢ ∧ dXⁱ + (1/2)πⁱʲ(X) ηᵢ ∧ ηⱼ

    For Σ = disk with two marked points 0, 1 on the boundary:
    - Feynman diagrams are exactly Kontsevich graphs Γ
    - Aerial vertices = insertions of π
    - Ground vertices = boundary insertions of f, g
    - Edge propagator = angle function φ
    - Graph weight w_Γ = ∫_{C_{n,m}} ∧ dφ_e = Feynman integral

    The star product f ⋆ g = ⟨f(X(0)) g(X(1))⟩ is the correlator. -/
