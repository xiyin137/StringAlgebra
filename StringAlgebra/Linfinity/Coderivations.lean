# Coderivations on the Symmetric Coalgebra

This file defines coderivations on the symmetric coalgebra, which are the
key objects in the coalgebraic definition of L∞ algebras.

## Main definitions

* `Coderivation` - A coderivation D on S(V) satisfying the co-Leibniz rule
* `squareZero` - The condition D² = 0

## Mathematical Background

A coderivation on a coalgebra (C, Δ) is a linear map D : C → C satisfying
the co-Leibniz rule:
  Δ ∘ D = (D ⊗ id + id ⊗ D) ∘ Δ

For the symmetric coalgebra S(V), coderivations are in bijection with
linear maps ⨁_{n≥1} Sym^n(V) → V. Given such a map f, the coderivation D_f
is uniquely determined by the co-Leibniz rule.

An L∞ algebra structure on V is equivalent to a degree 1 coderivation D
on S(V[1]) satisfying D² = 0.

## The Brackets

From a coderivation D, we extract the L∞ brackets:
  l_n : V^⊗n → V
by projecting D|_{Sym^n(V[1])} to V[1] and desuspending.

The condition D² = 0 encodes all the generalized Jacobi identities.

/-! ## Square-Zero Coderivations and L∞ Algebras

    The condition D² = 0 is the defining equation for L∞ algebras.
    When expanded in terms of brackets, this gives the generalized
    Jacobi identities at each word length. -/

/-- A coderivation is square-zero if D² = 0.

    This means for all x in the coalgebra, (D ∘ D)(x) is the zero element.
    Mathematically: D² = 0 ⟺ all generalized Jacobi identities hold. -/
def Coderivation.isSquareZero (D : Coderivation R V) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : SymCoalg R V, (D.square x).isZero = true

/-- A reduced coderivation is square-zero if D² = 0.

    This is the key condition for L∞ algebras:
    D² = 0 encodes all the generalized Jacobi identities. -/
def ReducedCoderivation.isSquareZero (D : ReducedCoderivation R V) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : ReducedSymCoalg R V, (D.square x).isZero = true

/-- An L∞ algebra structure on V is a degree 1 square-zero coderivation
    on the reduced symmetric coalgebra S⁺(V[1]).

    This is the fundamental theorem of the coalgebraic approach:

/-! ## Extracting Brackets -/

/-- The component of a coderivation at word length n.

    For a coderivation D on S⁺(V), this is the map
    D_n : Sym^n(V) → V
    obtained by composing D|_{Sym^n(V)} with projection to V = Sym^1(V). -/

    Unit :=  -- Placeholder for Sym^n(V) → V
  ()

/-- The n-th L∞ bracket l_n : V^⊗n → V.

    This is obtained from the coderivation D by:
    1. Taking the component D_n : Sym^n(V[1]) → V[1]
    2. Desuspending to get l_n : V^⊗n → V

    The degree of l_n is 2 - n. -/

    Unit :=  -- Placeholder for the actual bracket type
  ()

/-! ## Key Properties -/

/-- For an L∞ algebra, the bracket l₁ is a differential (l₁² = 0).

    This follows from D² = 0 by restricting to word length 1.
    In terms of the coderivation: for x of word length 1, (D ∘ D)(x) = 0. -/
theorem l1_is_differential (L : LInfinityStructure R V) :
    ∀ x : ReducedSymCoalg R (Shift V 1), x.wordLength = 1 →
      (L.D.square x).isZero = true := by
  intro x hx
  exact L.square_zero x

/-- For an L∞ algebra, l₁ is a derivation of l₂ up to l₃ correction.

    l₁(l₂(x,y)) = l₂(l₁x, y) + (-1)^|x| l₂(x, l₁y) + l₃-terms

    This follows from D² = 0 by restricting to word length 2.
    In terms of the coderivation: for x of word length 2, (D ∘ D)(x) = 0. -/
theorem l1_derivation_of_l2 (L : LInfinityStructure R V) :
    ∀ x : ReducedSymCoalg R (Shift V 1), x.wordLength = 2 →
      (L.D.square x).isZero = true := by
  intro x hx
  exact L.square_zero x

/-- The generalized Jacobi identity at level n.

    ∑_{i+j=n+1} ∑_σ ε(σ) l_j(l_i(x_{σ(1)}, ..., x_{σ(i)}), x_{σ(i+1)}, ..., x_{σ(n)}) = 0

    This is the coefficient of word length n in D² = 0.
    The proof follows directly from the square-zero condition on the coderivation. -/
theorem generalized_jacobi (L : LInfinityStructure R V) (n : ℕ) (_hn : n ≥ 1) :
    ∀ x : ReducedSymCoalg R (Shift V 1), x.wordLength = n →
      (L.D.square x).isZero = true := by
  intro x hx
  exact L.square_zero x

/-! ## Special Cases -/

/-- The coderivation vanishes on word length n inputs.

    This means D maps all elements of word length n to zero.
    Formally: for all x ∈ Sym^n(V[1]), we have D(x) = 0. -/
def ReducedCoderivation.vanishesOnWordLength (D : ReducedCoderivation R V) (n : ℕ) : Prop :=
  ∀ x : ReducedSymCoalg R V, x.wordLength = n → (D.map x).isZero = true

/-- A DGLA (differential graded Lie algebra) is an L∞ algebra
    where l_n = 0 for n ≥ 3.

    The Jacobi identity holds strictly (no higher homotopies).
    Equivalently, the coderivation D vanishes on inputs of word length ≥ 3. -/
def isDGLA (L : LInfinityStructure R V) : Prop :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 3 → L.D.vanishesOnWordLength n

/-- A Lie algebra is an L∞ algebra where l₁ = 0 and l_n = 0 for n ≥ 3.

    This means:
    - The differential l₁ vanishes (no differential)
    - Only the binary bracket l₂ is nonzero
    - The Jacobi identity holds strictly -/
def isLieAlgebra (L : LInfinityStructure R V) : Prop :=
  L.D.vanishesOnWordLength 1 ∧ isDGLA L

/-- A strict Lie 2-algebra is an L∞ algebra where l_n = 0 for n ≥ 4.

    This allows a nontrivial Jacobiator l₃ but no higher homotopies. -/
def isLie2Algebra (L : LInfinityStructure R V) : Prop :=
  ∀ n : ℕ, n ≥ 4 → L.D.vanishesOnWordLength n
